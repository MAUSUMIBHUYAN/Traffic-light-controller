This is a Traffic light controller, this project focuses on implementing a trained reinforcement learning-based traffic light controller for a single four-way intersection with four lanes per road (west, east, north, and south). The Deep Q-Network (DQN) model has trained using SUMO simulations for 2500 episodes, incorporating lane-specific data such as queue lengths, average waiting times, and vehicle counts into the state representation. The reward mechanism was designed to minimize average waiting time, ensuring efficient signal control. The controller will now be tested under varying traffic conditions (light, medium, and heavy) to evaluate its adaptability and robustness. Metrics such as average waiting time, queue length, cumulative delay, and total rewards will be analyzed to assess performance.
